# ClimateChange

ClimateChange is a program for computational ecology and computational evolutionary biology.
For variety and veracity, the project draws on genetics, meteorology, climatology, geology, and other scientific disciplines.
Only a small degree of flexibility is offered for the sake of optimization and coherency.

## About ClimateChange

We began ClimateChange to help with learning and researching evolution and ecology.
Our ambitious goal is to simulate evolution on a global scale.
Calculation of innumerable elements and agents by small time steps and small spatial distances on a large surface across eons will be a nearly impossible and correspondingly worthy goal.
By pairing a "standard model" with powerful analytic tools, we hope to make the mathematical visual.
