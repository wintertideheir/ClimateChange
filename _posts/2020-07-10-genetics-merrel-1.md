# Introduction to Genetics, Chapter 1

In the spirit of relearning, I've gone back to my
favorite introductory genetics textbook to create
a model of heredity for ClimateChange. This
chapter is a review of history, but I've found
some expectations we should have about
ClimateChange's genetic model.

1. **Reduction in information transmitted between parents and offspring.**
   Any representation of individuals will
   obviously include state information about them
   at each instant. But unexpectedly, the genetic
   information requires a lot of hard coding to
   sufficiently transform into a person.

   Merrel writes about how surprising it is that
   offspring look like their parents given the only
   link between them is sperm and egg. There is of
   course, wide reuse of genetic ideas. What Merrel
   doesn't delve into, however, is that chemicals
   tend to behave in orderly ways, and that order
   enables a smaller encoding.

   Similarly, we need to decide what living
   organisms we can represent long before writing
   the genetic interpretation mechanism.

2. **An interesting aside on Lamarck.**
   In "The Origin of Variation," Merrel explores
   other explanations for variation. Lamarck's
   theory is interesting for being technically
   wrong but right in spirit. I think
   ClimateChange ought to behave Lamarckian if
   you don't look closely enough.

3. **What and why genotypes and phenotypes?**
   Merrel begins introducing genotypes and
   phenotypes. I can read a lot of hidden complexity
   between the lines and I'm wary about the potential
   implications here.

Let's see if we can keep these general themes and
questions as we go forward.
