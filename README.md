# ClimateChange

ClimateChange was developed to better understand ecological dynamics and evolution across large time spans and distances with a varied and evolving climate.
It is impossible to completely simulate an entire organism, and very difficult to create even a mediocre approximation.
Therefore, our project focuses on observation of the macroscopic manifestations of life, a task firmly in the responsibility of ecology.
Evolution without variation is uninteresting, and so climatology and meteorology was brought in to paint a colorful world.
Our standard for success will be to observe complex phenomena from a simple implementation of foundational concepts.
