# ClimateChange

ClimateChange was developed to better understand
ecological dynamics and evolution across large
time spans and distances with a varied and
evolving climate. Development is being performed
in parallel.

* The `master` branch is the root branch for any
  new development pathways.
* The `gh-pages` branch is for GitHub Pages, and
  will serve as a temporary development blog.

Development of ClimateChange is partially a
chance for the developers to learn and relearn
various skills - therefore it's development will
be expected to complete late in 2024.
