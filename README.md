# ClimateChange

ClimateChange is a program for computational ecology and computational evolutionary biology.
For variety and veracity, the project draws on genetics, meteorology, climatology, geology, and other scientific disciplines.
Only a small degree of flexibility is offered for the sake of optimization and coherency.

## References

ClimateChange in part is a chance to learn or relearn new skills.
The development of the project depends on a few reference texts.
Sequences of parts, chapters, and sections correspond to the evolution of the model.
