# ClimateChange

ClimateChange is a program for computational ecology and computational evolutionary biology.
For variety and veracity, the project draws on genetics, meteorology, climatology, geology, and other scientific disciplines.
Only a small degree of flexibility is offered for the sake of optimization and coherency.

## NOTE WELL

While ClimateChange remains in alpha, this pages is merely a guide and subject to revision.

## Why We Wrote Climate Change

ClimateChange was borne out of three desires.

First, **we wanted to visualize the mathematics of evolution.**
A key ability we couldn't find elsewhere was to look at an ecological phenomena visually and graphically.
Being essential for learning and communication, a graph and cinematography intrface was developed for ClimateChange.
Furthermore, we wrote an API, a scripting language, and an export interface to enable further creativity.

Second, **we wanted to replicate evolution on a global scale.**
One of the joys of observing life on Earth is the stunning diversity and multitude of living organisms.
Limited as we are by computing power, we wanted to recreate part of that experience.
It wasn't strictly necessary for academic purposes, but a automated and manual taxonomic system was included to better understand the story of life.

Third, **we wanted to create a standard reference to study the real world by.**
ClimateChange is very computationally expensive and the size of saved simulations quite large.
Our solution was to create a single standard reference simulation that demonstrates all of the natural phenomena.
The standard notation can easily refer to time, eras, species, places, etc. within the standard reference.

## The References We Prefer

ClimateChange is in part a chance to learn or relearn skills.
It's development presently depends on the following reference texts.
The sequence of chapters in each text will correspond to the evolution of the model.
